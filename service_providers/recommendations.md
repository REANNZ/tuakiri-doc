# Recommendations

This page contains recommendations for setting up a Shibboleth SP in the Tuakiri Federation.

#### Dual Login

If you need to provide dual login (both a Tuakiri login option and custom username/password login option) for users, we recommend using the following text and logo to explain to users what the Tuakiri login entails:

| Users from many NZ universities and CRIs can log in  <br>with their username and password from their home  <br>institution using Tuakiri. |
| **\<Log in button\>** |

For the Tuakiri web logo, see [this link](https://rapidconnect.tuakiri.ac.nz/developers#logo-images).

An example on how to set up dual login technically with Shibboleth (using "lazy sessions") can be found [here](https://aai.kuleuven.be/shibboleth/examples/lazysessions/).
