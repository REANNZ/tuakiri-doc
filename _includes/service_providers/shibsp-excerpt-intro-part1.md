There is already a significant amount of documentation on installing a Shibboleth SP notably:

*   Understanding Shibboleth: how it all fits together: [https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/CONCEPT/FlowsAndConfig](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/CONCEPT/FlowsAndConfig) (useful for terminology and understanding how the Shibboleth SP uses session cookies)

*   Installation:Â [https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SP3/Installation](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SP3/Installation) (for installing on Linux, Mac, or Windows)

*   SWITCH SP Installation manual for Debian and Ubuntu: [https://www.switch.ch/aai/guides/sp/installation/](https://www.switch.ch/aai/guides/sp/installation/)

*   Configuration reference: [https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SP3/Configuration](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/SP3/Configuration)

This page draws on the above documents and gives the series of steps to install a Shibboleth SP and get it working in the Tuakiri federation.

This documentation now covers Shibboleth SP 3.x - though it does not significantly differ from 2.x for which this documentation was originally written.
